# SCS Cyber Team Resources

This is the repository that will store the UGA SCS Cyber Team information, resources, and challenges. The Resources section is broken up into the General and CTF folders:

**General**: Resources that contain general cyber security information and other interesting articles

**CTF**: Resources that contain technical information useful when training for CTF competitions

## Where to get started?

Let's be honest, who doesn't want to learn how to hack. It is a powerful skill that makes you feel like a BA, but getting started can be hard. It seems like there is a million and a half things to learn, and you would be right there are a lot of things to learn. However, like anything in life if you want to get it done you just need to start. Here are a few websites that many others and I have found help us take that first leap of faith. This list will be updated periodically.
