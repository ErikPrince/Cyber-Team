# 13

This challenge uses a special [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) called ROT13. [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) - "rotate by 13" is implemented by moving each letter by 13 places in the alphabet. A becomes N, B becomes O, C becomes P and so on.

Once we use [cryptii](https://cryptii.com) to decode this we get the flag `picoCTF{not_too_bad_of_a_problem}`

You will notice many picoCTF flags are phrases separated by _ using l33t speak.
