## So how do I start participating in CTFs?

The road to CTFs is going to be challenging and rewarding. Persistence and patience will be the only way you will successfully build your hacking skills.

Begin by making sure you have your basics down and are comfortable with the Linux command line (guide above). Once done begin to check out the picoCTF competition, a CTF competition recommended for beginners.
