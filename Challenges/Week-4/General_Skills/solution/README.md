# Solution

This challenge involves our first brute force!

> "In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found." -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack

To complete this challenge, we need to try every single combination of a 4 digit keycode. We could do this manually... but that would take way too long. Instead, we can create a program to do it!
