# Solution

This challenge involves our first binary exploitation!

> Binary exploitation is the process of subverting a compiled application such that it violates some trust boundary in a way that is advantageous to you, the attacker. -- https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/exploits/binary1.html

To complete this challenge, all we need to do is change the value of the `exploitme` varaible. To do this, we are going to overflow the `buffer` variable to change the value of `exploitme`. This can easily be done sending more characters to the buffer than the 8 that were expected.
