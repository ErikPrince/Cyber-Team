# Challenges

This is a directory for storing the challenges used by the Cyber Team throughout the semester.

Once you have completed a challenge, get credit for your work! Email ugascs[at]gmail.com with 'Hacking Hours 10/23/19 Flags' and your name in the subject line and the flags you discovered in the message body so the SCS Executive team knows you solved the puzzles!
