This first cryptography problem is a Caesar cipher, more specifically a ROT-13 cipher.

> ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", sometimes hyphenated ROT-13) is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it, in the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher which was developed in ancient Rome.

The website Cyber Chef (https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) has a ROT-13 cipher decoding function built in. The cipher used can be deducted by both the hints and the syntax/form of the ciphertext, which retains the ugascs{flag} format.
